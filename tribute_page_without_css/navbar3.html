                Ruler of Mewar  
            </h1>  

        <p>  
            Rana Pratap Singh (born 1545?, Mewar [India]—died January 19, 1597, Mewar) Hindu maharaja (1572–97) of the Rajput confederacy of Mewar, now in northwestern India and eastern Pakistan. He successfully resisted efforts of the Mughal emperor Akbar to conquer his area and is honoured as a hero in Rajasthan.
            The son and successor of the weak Rana Udai Singh, Rana Pratap sought to avenge the 1567 pillage of his capital, Chitor, and subsequent raids by Akbar; this was in notable contrast to his fellow Hindu princes, who had submitted to the Mughals. Rana Pratap reorganized the government, improved the forts, and directed his subjects to take refuge in the mountain country when attacked by Mughals. After insulting one of Akbar’s emissaries and refusing an alliance, he was defeated in June 1576 by Mughal forces at Haldighat and fled to the hills. Despite the loss of many of his strongholds, he continued to harass the Mughals and urged noncooperation and passive resistance to Akbar’s tax collectors.
            In the meantime, Mewar declined to a wasteland.
